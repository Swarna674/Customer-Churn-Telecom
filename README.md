# Customer-Churn-Telecom
Churn prediction using machine learning for a telecom dataset. Built with Google Colab, Python, and basic ML models.
# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction – Telecom Industry

Predicting customer churn using machine learning to help telecom companies reduce attrition and boost loyalty.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major problem for telecom firms. This project builds a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave.

## 📊 Key Steps

- **EDA:** Checked customer demographics, services, and churn rate
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new flags from categorical variables
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC

## 🔍 Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (pandas, seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib)
- ML Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Visualizations for business insights

## 🧾 Outcomes
- Found top churn indicators: contract type, tenure, monthly charges
- Achieved ~82% model accuracy
- Suggested actionable retention strategies

## 📁 Files
- `Customer-Churn-Telecom.ipynb` – Main notebook with code & insights

## 🚀 Future Work
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
- Add feature importance with SHAP
- Test with deep learning models (optional)
